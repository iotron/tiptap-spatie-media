## Introduction

**Spatie Media Integration Support for Tiptap Editor** is a package that seamlessly integrates the Tiptap Editor with Spatie's Media Library, providing an easy way to manage and upload media within your Tiptap Editor. Built specifically for Laravel and Filament, this package extends the functionalities of the popular [Tiptap Editor](https://filamentphp.com/plugins/awcodes-tiptap-editor), making it a breeze to handle images and media directly within your rich text editing experience.

This package allows developers to customize the `media_action` configuration of the Tiptap Editor with just a single line change, enabling media upload management via Filament's Spatie Media Library integration. Once set up, users can effortlessly manage their media, giving a seamless media management experience.

> **Note**: This package requires the Tiptap Editor to be installed before you can use it.

## Features

- Integrate Tiptap Editor with Spatie's Media Library.
- Easily upload and manage images within the Tiptap Text Editor.
- Supports customization via a simple configuration change.

## Installation

You can install the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require iotronlab/tiptap-spatie-media
```

## âš¡ Quick Setup

To quickly integrate **Tiptap Spatie Media** into your Laravel project, simply run:

```bash
php artisan tiptap-spatie-media:install
```

This command will:

- Automatically publish the `filament-tiptap-editor.php` config file (if not already published).
- Inject the correct `media_action` class reference:
  ```php
  'media_action' => \Iotronlab\TiptapSpatieMedia\TiptapSpatieMediaAction::class,
  ```
- Configure the editor to support media uploads via Spatie's Media Library.

âœ… You're now ready to use Tiptap with Spatie Media support!

## ðŸ›  Manual Installation

Prefer to configure things manually? Follow these steps:

### 1. Publish the configuration file

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="filament-tiptap-editor-config"
```

### 2. Update the configuration

In the published `config/filament-tiptap-editor.php`, locate the `media_action` key and modify it like so:

```php
// Comment out or remove the default action
// 'media_action' => FilamentTiptapEditor\Actions\MediaAction::class,

// Replace with the custom media action
'media_action' => \Iotronlab\TiptapSpatieMedia\TiptapSpatieMediaAction::class,
```

ðŸ’¡ This change tells Filament's Tiptap Editor to use Spatieâ€™s Media Library for managing media uploads.

---

You're now fully set up to manage media in Tiptap using the power of Spatie's Laravel Media Library!

## Usage

Use the Tiptap Editor as you normally would:

```php
TiptapEditor::make('description')
    ->columnSpanFull(),
```

Just ensure that you have updated the Tiptap Editor config file with the new `media_action`, and you're all set to manage media uploads seamlessly.
